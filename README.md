# Transportation Carrier Performance Visualization

## Overview

This project analyzes carrier shipping data from a CSV file to derive key performance metrics. It uses Python with the pandas library for data manipulation and Matplotlib/Seaborn for generating visualizations. The script calculates on-time delivery percentages, average delay times for late shipments, and shipment volume over time, saving the output as PNG image files.

## Features

- **Data Loading:** Loads data from a CSV file into a pandas DataFrame.
- **Feature Engineering:** Calculates new data points like `delay_days` and a boolean `on_time` status for each shipment.
- **Performance Metrics:**
  - Calculates the on-time delivery percentage for each carrier.
  - Calculates the average delay in days for shipments that were not on time.
  - Aggregates total shipments by month to show trends.
- **Data Visualization:** Generates and saves three key visualizations.
